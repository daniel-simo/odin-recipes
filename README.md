This is my first project. this prject will show i am confident with HTML. It will show my use of writing out the boilerplate, using headings, paragraphs, images, includings links using anchors, and also that i can organise my files correctly. by the end it should show i am competent with HTML.
After completion i am pretty happy with my work i just need to remember to keep stopping and commiting as i just got carried away with the project.
